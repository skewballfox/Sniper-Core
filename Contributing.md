since this is meant to be a project with multiple layers, eventually you'll have to figure out if this is the repo you want to open an issue with, it's a bit early to really worry about that.

please open an issue if you want to make any changes. while I don't mind being surprised with a pull requests, I'm still figuring things out, and this may lead to problems with double spending in terms of work put into a particular part. 

I definitely could use help both with the code part, and the syntax definition. Also if you have any suggestions on either the design or the implementation, or have thought of a potential feature/usecase I didn't mention, please feel free to bring it up.

Also, if you want to implement it in an particular editor please feel free to do so, just remember that the while the component behavior will likely remain the same (sniper-{EDITOR} handling context/state-management and sniper-core storage/manipulation/retrieval), the way they interact is likely to change.
